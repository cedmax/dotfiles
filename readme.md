## note to anyone else
I have to give credits to my buddy [Luca](https://sirlisko.com/blog/dotfiles-one-to-rule-them-all/) (yes, I have to, he actually asked for it): even tho he didn't invent dotfiles or the idea of storing them on github, he's the very first one who put the idea in my head of actually doing it.
